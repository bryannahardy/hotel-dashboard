# hotel-dashboard
In this repository, it includes a data analysis project, that I have followed through on YouTube to gain experience with Power BI. I have created a dashboard for a hotel where you can figure out certain information about the hotel, such as, revenue on a certain year.

I builded a database with Microsoft SQL Server, I have analyzed and retrieved data with SQL, connected Power BI to a database, and visualized data in Power BI. The dashboard lets you retain certain information about the hotel that you would like to know. In addition, there are features that let you use a slider to choose a range of dates and there are two drop down boxes that includes the hotels listed and the countries that the hotels are located.

The questions that the hotel wanted to know were:
  1. Is our hotel revenue growing by year?
  2. Should we increase our parking lot size?
  3. What trends can we see in the data?

With the hotel dashboard, that I have created we can simply answer these questions for the stakeholders.
